# .env.example
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000

#**Note:** If youâ€™re only running a single Vite frontend on your system, the default link will usually be http://localhost:5173. When you start the frontend with npm run dev, the exact link will be shown in your terminal. After confirming it, use that link as the value of FRONTEND_URL in your .env file.

#For production, set FRONTEND_URL to your deployed frontend link.
